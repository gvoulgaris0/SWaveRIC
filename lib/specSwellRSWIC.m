%% specSwellRSWIC.m
%  Function to estimate swell spectrum (Gaussian shape) and wave height
%%
function [Sfs] = specSwellRSWIC(fw,fs,hrms,sigma)

%% Inputs
%  fw       = wave frequency array
%  fs       = swell wave frequency
%  hrms     = rms waveheight of swell
%  sigma    = Gaussian width

%% Output
%  Sfs      = swell wave frequency spectrum
