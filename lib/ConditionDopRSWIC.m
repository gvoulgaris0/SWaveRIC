%% ConditionDopRSWIC.m
%
%  Script that:       
%   1. Loads all setup parameters from the ConfigRWIC.m file
%   2. Identifies and removes noise level from Doppler spectrum 
%   3. Locates 1st order Bragg peaks 
%   4. Applies a Gaussian curve fitting to the Bragg peaks
%      (used for Bragg peak integration and 2nd order sideband low frequency limits)
%   5. Integrates Bragg peaks using the Gaussian halfwidth from fit
