%% swell_singular.m
%  Function to remove invalid swell inversion. Swell inversion fails at 
%  high cross angles. The limit is dependent on HF operating frequency. 
%  For radar frequencies of 4, 12, and 48 MHz singularities occur for swell 
%  cross angles |Î¸_s |>60^o,75^o and 85^o, 
%%
function [fsi,Hswi,Thsi] = swell_singular(fs,Hsw,Ths,thc2,beamdiff,fr)
%% Inputs
%  fs:          - swell frequency (Hz) 
%  Hsw:         - swell rms waveheight (m) 
%  Ths:         - swell direction (degrees) 
%  thc2:        -(degrees) swell cross angle to beam 1
%  fr           - HF radar operating frequency  (in Mhz)
%  beamdiff     - the angle between two rdara beams

%% Outputs 
%  fsi:          - swell frequency (Hz) 
%  Hswi:         - swell rms waveheight (m) 
%  Thsi:         - swell direction (degrees)
